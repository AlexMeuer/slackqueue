This readme is a stub. I hope to expand it soon.

To run this, set the `SLACK_TOKEN` env var, then run the program. You'll need to register the app with Slack seperately and expose this program to it somehow, whether that's cloud hosting or a tool like ngrok.

As of writing this, the program doesn't verify that requests actuall come from slack. That's a major TODO.
